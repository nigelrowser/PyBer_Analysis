### The data shows that urban areas spend much more on fare compared to rural and suburban areas. There are many factors that affect this conclusion. Typically more people tend to live in urban areas. The data shows that there are 2,405 drivers in urban areas, 490 drivers in suburban areas, and only 78 drivers in rural areas. Urban areas also had the most total rides which was at 1,625 rides. 

## Summary
### Business Recommendations

#### 1. Business marketing efforts should be focused on urban areas due to the percieved increase in competition because of the amount of riders and the need for service.
#### 2. The business should continue to recruit and hire urban drivers so the company is able to keep up with demand. 
#### 3. The company should weigh the cost of doing business versus the reward in regards on deciding to continue to serve rural areas because there are few riders.
